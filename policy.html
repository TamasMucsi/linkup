        <div class="row policymain">
            <p class="justify">
                Welcome to LinkUp, a community-driven space where people come together to share stories, links, ideas,
                and conversations.
                To keep LinkUp open, welcoming, and safe for everyone, we’ve built a few ground rules.
                By using LinkUp, you agree to follow these policies, along with our Terms of Service and Privacy
                Policy.
            </p>


            <hr>
            <h4>1. Community Guidelines</h4>
            <p>LinkUp thrives on respect, curiosity, and creativity.
                Here’s what’s expected of every member:</p>
            <h4>1.1 Respect Others</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Be kind. No harassment, hate speech, threats, or bullying.</li>
                <li>Do not post content that discriminates based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, nationality, or
                    disability.</li>
                <li>Attack ideas, not people.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.2 Keep It Real</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Don’t spam, self-promote excessively, or post repetitive content.</li>
                <li>Don’t use bots or fake accounts to manipulate votes, trends, or engagement.</li>
                <li>Don’t impersonate other users, public figures, or LinkUp staff.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.3 Follow the Law</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not post, share, or encourage illegal activities.</li>
                <li>No pirated materials, stolen content, or anything that violates copyright law.</li>
                <li>Never share private or identifying information about others without consent (“doxxing”).</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.4 NSFW & Sensitive Content</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>NSFW (Not Safe For Work) posts are allowed in designated communities only — and must be clearly
                    labeled.</li>
                <li>NSFW content must not include nudity involving minors, sexual exploitation, or non-consensual acts.
                </li>
                <li>Communities can choose to disallow NSFW material entirely.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.5 Age Requirement</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>You must be 13 years or older to use LinkUp.</li>
                <li>Certain areas of the site may require you to be 18+.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>





            <h4>2. Moderation Policy</h4>
            <p class="justify">Moderation keeps LinkUp safe and constructive.
                Our moderation system has two layers — community moderators and the LinkUp Trust & Safety team.</p>
            <h4>2.1 Community Moderators</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Each community (“Link”) has volunteer moderators who set and enforce their local rules.</li>
                <li>Mods can remove posts, issue bans, and lock threads.</li>
                <li>Moderators are expected to act fairly, transparently, and within the bounds of LinkUp’s global
                    policy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.2 Platform Enforcement</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The LinkUp team may step in for serious or repeated violations.</li>
                <li>Actions may include warnings, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans.</li>
                <li>If you believe an action was taken in error, you can appeal by contacting appeals@linkup.com</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>



            <h4>3. Content Ownership & Copyright</h4>
            <h4>3.1 You Own Your Content</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Anything you post on LinkUp is yours.</li>
                <li>By posting, you grant LinkUp a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to display,
                    distribute, and host your content as part of the platform’s operation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3.2 Copyright Infringement (DMCA)</h4>
            <p>If you believe your copyrighted work has been posted without permission, send a DMCA notice to: <a
                    href="mailto:legal@linkup.com">legal@linkup.com</a></p>
            <p>Your message must include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your full contact details</li>
                <li>A description of the copyrighted material</li>
                <li>The exact URL(s) of the infringing content</li>
                <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on their
                    behalf</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>



            <h4>4. Privacy & Data Use</h4>
            <p>We respect your privacy.</p>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and how we use it, but here’s the short
                version:</p>

                <li>We may use anonymized data to analyze trends and improve features.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>


            <h4>5. Reporting Problems</h4>

            </ul>
            <hr>




            <h4>6. Enforcement & Penalties</h4>
            <p>Depending on the nature and frequency of a violation, possible actions include:</p>

                <li>Temporary suspension of your account</li>

            <hr>


            <h4>7. Transparency</h4>
            <p>We believe in accountability.</p>

                <li>Appeal outcomes</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
